**Bringing Memories Back to Life**

![RekindleAR Demo](ADD LINK)

## 📖 Overview
*RekindleAR* is a pioneering augmented reality (AR) tool for enabling people with alzhiemers, dementia, and other memory-loss related conditions to rekindle with memories they may have forgotten about. By integrating advanced technologies, *RekindleAR* redefines the way people can experience memories in an immersive envirnoment, utilizing the Spectacles by Snapchat. Our mission is to equip people suffering from memory-related issues with an AR experience to engage with their loved ones and lost memories. Ultimately improving their happiness, memory recollection, and feelings of isolation.

## 🚀 Inspiration
The journey to create *RekindleAR* was fueled by a profound understanding of current memory-loss related disorders. Alzheimer’s disease, specifically, is a leading cause of dementia that affects millions of people worldwide, gradually robbing individuals of their memory, cognitive functions, and sense of identity. As the disease progresses, patients often lose the ability to recognize their surroundings, loved ones, and significant personal objects, leading to confusion, anxiety, and isolation. This not only impacts the quality of life for patients but also places an emotional burden on caregivers and family members. Current therapeutic options for Alzheimer’s patients focus primarily on pharmacological treatments and traditional cognitive therapy, but there is a growing need for innovative, non-invasive solutions to assist with memory recall and cognitive rehabilitation.
