# memoryRevival
Alzheimer’s disease, a leading cause of dementia, affects millions of people worldwide, gradually robbing individuals of their memory, cognitive functions, and sense of identity. As the disease progresses, patients often lose the ability to recognize their surroundings, loved ones, and significant personal objects, leading to confusion, anxiety, and isolation. This not only impacts the quality of life for patients but also places an emotional burden on caregivers and family members. Current therapeutic options for Alzheimer’s patients focus primarily on pharmacological treatments and traditional cognitive therapy, but there is a growing need for innovative, non-invasive solutions to assist with memory recall and cognitive rehabilitation.

The AR Memory Revival app offers a personalized augmented reality experience that overlays digital information on real-world objects, family photos, and familiar locations. By using visual cues to trigger memory recall, the app helps Alzheimer's patients better recognize their environment, aiding cognitive rehabilitation. Key features include:
AR Object Identification: When viewing an object, the app will display associated memories, such as stories or names of people connected to the object.
Family Photo Recognition: Using facial recognition, the app overlays names and past interactions over family photos to aid recognition.
Familiar Location Mapping: Overlays geotagged memories onto locations, helping users navigate their surroundings with confidence and triggering location-based recall.
This app provides an engaging, non-pharmacological tool to improve cognitive function and emotional well-being for Alzheimer's patients.
