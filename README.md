# RekindleAR

**Bringing Memories Back to Life**

![RekindleAR Demo](https://github.com/meghagoddu/memoryRevival/blob/main/RekindleARLogo.png)

## 📖 Overview
*RekindleAR* is a pioneering augmented reality (AR) tool for enabling people with Alzheimer’s, dementia, and other memory-loss-related conditions to reconnect with memories they may have forgotten. By integrating advanced technologies, *RekindleAR* redefines the way people experience memories in an immersive environment, utilizing Spectacles by Snapchat. Our mission is to equip people suffering from memory-related issues with an AR experience that helps them engage with their loved ones and lost memories, ultimately improving their happiness, memory recollection, and reducing feelings of isolation.

## 🚀 Inspiration
The journey to create *RekindleAR* was fueled by a profound understanding of current memory-loss-related disorders. Alzheimer’s disease, specifically, is a leading cause of dementia that affects millions of people worldwide, gradually robbing individuals of their memory, cognitive functions, and sense of identity. As the disease progresses, patients often lose the ability to recognize their surroundings, loved ones, and significant personal objects, leading to confusion, anxiety, and isolation. This impacts the quality of life for patients and places an emotional burden on caregivers and family members. While current therapeutic options focus on pharmacological treatments and traditional cognitive therapy, there is a growing need for innovative, non-invasive solutions to assist with memory recall and cognitive rehabilitation.

## 🎯 What It Does
*RekindleAR* offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to enhance the experience of virtually reliving memories and seeing loved ones:

- **Real-time AR Overlays**: Allows users to see their loved ones virtually in front of them, displaying videos and audios based on the person the user is viewing.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: A web app that integrates with cloud storage and APIs to run facial recognition and pattern-tracking algorithms for this multi-modal experience.
- **Caregiver Application**: An iOS application for family and caregivers to add their photos and audio for their elderly loved one’s AR experience, along with memory tracking for recognition of loved ones and health data.
- **Safety Features**: Spectacles offer a lightweight and seamless AR experience and can be customized to the user’s vision and physical abilities.
